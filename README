Kali config
===========
Created Wednesday 04 August 2021

Zim: Install plugins: Edit -> Preferences -> Plugins -> Attachements Browser/Tasks List, both add to panes.

Windows 10:
Ctrl+Win+Arrow Keys -> move to right/left workspace
Alt+Tab -> Change window on current workspace
Win+Tab -> Enter task view and then Ctrl+Win+Arrow Keys to change workspace inside view, Arrow/Page keys to navigate over windows.

Kali:
~/.bashrc -> HISTSIZE=10000, HISTFILESIZE=20000, PROMPT_ALTERNATIVE=oneline, NEWLINE_BEFORE_PROMPT=no (users marm/root)
Keyboard -> Application Shortcuts -> exo-open --launch TerminalEmulator Ctrl+Alt+T
Window Manager -> Keyboard -> Previous/Next workspace - Ctrl+Win+Left/Right
Alt+Insert -> New workspace
Alt+Delete -> Delete last workspace
Win+Arrow Up -> Maximize screen

copy .tmux.conf in home folder ~/
sudo apt-get install --assume-yes xclip - for command line X clipboard manipulations
Installed tmux 3.1c-1, version important because config commands can change drastically.

Copy aliases list to ~/.bash_aliases

In qterminal File->Preference->Shortcut redefine all hotkeys to not use Alt most importantly.
I don't know how to unset hotkey, so just changed config in ~/.config/qterminal.org/qterminal.ini,
unset all Alt combinations to empty behind equal sign.

which tmux -> to find path and then
 
sudo chsh -s /usr/bin/tmux marm (logout needed)
